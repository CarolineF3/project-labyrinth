# Project Labyrinth

This is a React app in the form of a game, which retrieves a list of actions from the backend and presents them to the user as interactable items.

## The problem

We started out by looking into Postman, trying to get a grasp of the features. We continued by creating some components, adding logic and making sure everything worked OK. We had some problems with the second fetch and spent some time trying to figure out how to send the coordinates. We decided to use styled components which made it easier to render different background images for each step.

If we had more time, we would have looked into reusable components.

Technologies: API, Postman, React, Redux, Styled Components, Thunks.
